# Flowise + OpenSearch Setup Guide 🚀

This guide provides a **step-by-step installation** of **Flowise** with **OpenSearch** on Ubuntu using **Docker**.

## 📥 Download the Agent  
You can download the agent from the official repository:  
➡️ **[GitHub - Flowise OpenSearch Agent](https://github.com/sto0ka/flowise_opensearch)**

---

## Step 1: Install Required Dependencies  

Before starting, install Docker if it's not already installed.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose curl
```

Ensure Docker is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

---

## Step 2: Create a Custom Docker Network  

To ensure Flowise and OpenSearch can communicate, create a dedicated **Docker network**:

```bash
docker network create flowise-net
```

---

## Step 3: Run OpenSearch  

Start OpenSearch: (**Create your own strong password - it is 100% required as Opensearch will **refuse** to start if **weak**password is used)

```bash
docker run -d --name opensearch \
  --network flowise-net \
  -p 9200:9200 -p 9600:9600 \
  -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
  -e "plugins.ml_commons.only_run_on_ml_node=false" \
  -e 'OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=StrongPass!123' \
  -e "DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN=true" \
  -e "OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms2g -Xmx2g" \
  opensearchproject/opensearch:latest
```

✅ **Fixes Applied:**  
- `DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN=true` → Disables SSL so OpenSearch works with **HTTP**. For some reason Flowise refuses to work with **HTTPS** 
- `-Xms2g -Xmx2g` → Prevents OpenSearch from **crashing due to low memory**.  

### **Wait 2-3 minutes for OpenSearch to fully start** before moving to the next step.

Check if OpenSearch is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

Verify OpenSearch responds:

```bash
curl -u 'admin:StrongPass!123' http://localhost:9200
```

---

## Step 4: Run Flowise in the Same Network  

Start Flowise:

```bash
docker run -d --name flowise \
  --network flowise-net \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ~/.flowise:/root/.flowise \
  flowiseai/flowise:latest
```

Confirm Flowise is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

---

## Step 5: Configure Flowise to Connect to OpenSearch  

1. Open **Flowise UI** at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Go to `Credentials > OpenSearch`**
3. **Enter OpenSearch Details:**
   - **Host**: `http://opensearch:9200` *(HTTP, not HTTPS)*
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `StrongPass!123` (use your configured password)
   - **Index Name**: `flowise_vectors`
4. **Save & Restart Flowise.**

---

## 🚀 Success! Now You Can Start Using Flowise & OpenSearch  

Flowise is now connected to OpenSearch and ready for **vector-based AI workflows**.

👉 **Open Flowise at `http://localhost:3000` and start building!** 🔥
